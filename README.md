# p4install
This reposirty contains one BASH script that install a full-fledged P4 environment on your UBUNTU 16.04

This does not necessarily claim that it will not work on other versions or even on a pure Debian, but during the installing phase, you should be careful about the versions and package names as they might differ.

## Usage
```
$ sudo ./install-ubuntu16.04.sh
```
